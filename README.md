# blog sample

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/efkbook/blog-sample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/efkbook/blog-sample)

A kind of blog for presentating EFK stack features.

* Write, view and search blog posts.
* Sing up, Login. Session is based on cookie.
* Collect page views and search logs into Elasticsearch via fluentd in Real-Time.
* Of course, you can view and analyze user actions in Elasticsearch and Kibana.

This repository includes following.

* [fluent/fluentd](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd) v0.12
* [uken/fluent-plugin-elasticsearch](https://github.com/uken/fluent-plugin-elasticsearch)
* Elastic v5 (Elasticsearch and Kibana)
* Simple blog application based on [suzuken/wiki](https://github.com/suzuken/wiki) written in Go.

## Prerequisite

* Docker

For local development,

* Go (>= 1.8)
* sqlite3

## Using Docker: make run

If you using docker, it's easy to work with Elastic stack and fluentd!
    # set GOPATH variable
    # export GOPATH=/root/go
    # make directory
    mkdir /root/go
    mkdir -p /root/go/src/github.com/efkbook
    # change directory
    cd /root/go/src/github.com/efkbook
    # git clone
    git clone https://github.com/efkbook/blog-sample
    # database migration
    make migrate/up
    # build binary
    make app/build
    # running docker containers by `docker-compose up -d`
    make run

At the first time, `docker-compose` start creating containers. After starting containers, it's time to access Elasticsearch.

    $ curl http://localhost:9200
    {
      "name" : "o2r0AqN",
      "cluster_name" : "docker-cluster",
      "cluster_uuid" : "KoAk04RXRbSx3wgLiB_LtA",
      "version" : {
        "number" : "5.4.3",
        "build_hash" : "eed30a8",
        "build_date" : "2017-06-22T00:34:03.743Z",
        "build_snapshot" : false,
        "lucene_version" : "6.5.1"
      },
      "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
    }

It works! And your Kibana console is also available on `http://localhost:5601`. If Elasticsearch is accecible, blog application can start up.

## For contributor

To start a blog application locally, you just `go run`

    go run main.go

To add some external packages, use `godep`. If you want to use Elasticsearch and/or Fluentd on docker container, you can specify each host via flag. When blog app running on container, Elasticsearch and Fluentd are accessed by using docker links.
